    # ‚òÅÔ∏è ECS Role generator
    ## Description
    {{ .Header }}
    This module is able to create IAM roles (either execution roles, or task roles) for ECS tasks, and attach the required policies to them.
    * üöÄ Allow the generation of an execution role, to be attached to a task definition or to an ecs service.
    * üöÄ Allow the generation of a task role, to be attached to a task definition.
    * üöÄ Allow the generation of a task role, to be attached to a task definition, and attach the required policies to it.

    This module pretends to be used as a safer way to create ECS task definitions, by using the `terraform` way to create them, and parsing the resulting object as a valid .json
    that can be used in an ECS service.

    ## Example
    Examples of this module's usage are available in the [examples](./examples) folder.

    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../examples/ecs-task-definition/basic/main.tf" }}
    ```

    For module composition, It's recommended to take a look at the module's `outputs` to understand what's available:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "outputs.tf" }}
    ```
